# Project_Swachalan

This project focuses on automating electric appliances in a small room to big corporate offices to reduce electricity consumption. It simply makes use of the CCTV cameras installed in the rooms to periodically monitor the presence of humans in a room. If the room is big, it checks for the coordinates too. Requiring no additional and complex hardware, this project can be implemented very easily.
