# Project_Swachalan

This project focuses on automating electric appliances in a small room to big corporate offices to reduce electricity consumption. It simply makes use of the CCTV cameras installed in the rooms to periodically monitor the presence of humans in a room. If the room is big, it checks for the coordinates too by dividing the image into two halves using image processing tools. Requiring no additional and complex hardware, this project can be implemented very easily.
