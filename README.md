# Project_Swachalan
This project was named SWACHALAN that defined in Sanskrit as "automation".
Swachalan focuses on automating electric appliances in a small room to big corporate offices to reduce electricity consumption. It simply makes use of the CCTV cameras installed in the rooms to periodically monitor the presence of humans in a room. If the room is big, it checks for the coordinates too by dividing the image into two halves using image processing tools. Requiring no additional and complex hardware, this project can be implemented very easily.

Tools and hardwares used are:
open CV2 library of python 2.7,
Arduino IDE,
Camera system,
Electrical appliances for interfacing

The unique element about this project is that the implementation of this would hardly cost anything. It efficienty eliminates the detection of any other unwanted similar objects. The code written to develop this project is very simple that can be understood any beginner easily. The bonus factor is that it is highly energy efficient. :)

To Run/Implement this project you simply need to have Python 2 versions installed in your systems as OpenCV library is compatible with this version of python. If you wish to run this in Python3 , make sure you have version 3.4 or later to get the compatibility of OpenCV. Install Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to 9600. Make sure the port numbers and COM port of your system and Arduino board match. Interface your camera system and appliances and you are good to go!!

Thank You
